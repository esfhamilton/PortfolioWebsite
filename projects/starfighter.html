                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Starfighter is a modern version of the arcade game "Asteroids" designed with more of an endless/ arena based setting and various twists.<br><br>This was created for my Computer Science project during college and was wrote in Unity using C#. Further developments were intended such as a shop system for players to upgrade their spaceship. However, this was the submitted product.<br><br>
